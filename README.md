# Guidelines

This specification describes the Polkadot relay chain and its system parachains.

Other parachains might declare themselves to "Polkadot-system-parachain-compatible".

This specification must **not** contain anything that hasn't been deployed to production or isn't about to be deployed to production. Feel free, however, to open pull requests for future changes, including early prototypes. Pull requests for future changes are helpful for implementation developers to be able implement and test an upcoming change ahead of time.
