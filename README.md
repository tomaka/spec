# Guidelines

This specification describes the Polkadot relay chain and its system parachains.
Other parachains might declare themselves to "Polkadot-system-parachain-compatible".

This specification must **not** contain anything that hasn't been deployed to production or isn't about to be deployed to production. Feel free, however, to open pull requests for future changes (including early prototypes).
