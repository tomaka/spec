## About conformance

While this document should be used as a reference document when it comes to reviewing an implementation or writing tests, it is important to note that the Polkadot network is a peer-to-peer network and that there exists no mechanism in order to punish non-conforming implementations.

While an implementation can assume that the peers it connects to follow this specification, it should not misbehave or crash if this assumption turns out to be false.
