# Requirements

In order to conform to this specification, a **validator** should:

- Listen for incoming networking connections.
- Attempt to connect to the other nodes.
- Publish its address using authority-discovery.
- Author blocks at a speed superior or equal to the reference implementation running on the reference hardware. TODO define?
- After it has authored a block, send to a large set of peers a *block announce* concerning this block.
- Have a transactions pool.
- Run offchain workers
- 

TODO finish

These requirements should be seen as *minimal requirements*, and are in no way a guarantee that running this validator will get rewards. It is fundamentally impossible to guarantee rewards, given that some aspects are out of control of the implementation and of the node operator (for example Internet cables being severed).

## Generating session keys

TODO: move this section somewhere else

Given a *block header*, the **session keys** can be generated by following these steps:

TODO: describe input and check API version and all

- Perform a *runtime call* of the function `SessionKeys_generate_session_keys`, with keystore host functions enabled.
- The output of this runtime call is the **session keys**.

> **Note**: The runtime call to `SessionKeys_generate_session_keys` is expected to call host functions such as `ext_crypto_sr25519_generate_version_1` which insert private keys into the *keystore* TODO: keystore not defined.
